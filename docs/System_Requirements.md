# ChartEdge - System Requirements

## 1. Introduction
ChartEdge is a lightweight, high-performance open-source charting library, focused on financial data visualization (e.g., trading charts) with future flexibility for broader data types.

## 2. Purpose
- Provide fast, interactive charts for web applications.
- Enable real-time data updates and streaming support.
- Support user annotations: lines, rectangles, circles, angles, text.
- Deliver high design flexibility (themes, custom styles).
- Prepare for future extensions: indicators, plugins, and mobile responsiveness.

## 3. Scope
- Web-based chart rendering (initially Canvas 2D).
- TypeScript project structure.
- No external rendering libraries (D3.js, etc.).
- Planned optional WebGL upgrade in the future.

## 4. Functional Requirements
- Line chart and candlestick chart.
- Pan and zoom capabilities.
- Tooltip or fixed value box when hovering data points.
- Data append (live updating).
- Support for data streaming via API.
- Add static shapes (lines, rectangles, circles, angles, text) via API.
- Interactive drawing and editing of shapes (future phase).
- Theme and style configuration at initialization and runtime.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Must maintain 60fps performance even with thousands of data points.
- Modular architecture to enable partial builds (tree-shaking).
- Simple and intuitive public API.
- Minimal bundle size.
- Cross-browser compatibility (latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Mobile-friendly rendering (stretch goal).

## 6. Technical Requirements
- Language: TypeScript (strict mode).
- Build Tool: Vite.
- Rendering: HTML5 Canvas 2D.
- Styling: Custom CSS (no framework like Tailwind).
- GitHub hosting for code, issues, and documentation.
- Testing Framework: Vitest.

## 7. Limitations
- No initial support for 3D charts.
- No out-of-the-box indicators (RSI, MACD) in MVP.
- No data storage; all data must be passed from client-side.

## 8. Future Extensions
- WebGL renderer for massive datasets.
- Indicator plugins.
- Responsive mode (mobile touch gestures).
- Export charts as images (PNG, SVG).
- Collaborative drawing mode (multi-user annotations).
